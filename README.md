## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the **EMO-7 Framework Reference Guide**! EMO-7 is a **flexible, seven-digit system** designed to help you capture and remember significant moments by combining your emotions with the details of the event. Whether it's a real experience or something imagined, EMO-7 offers a simple way to encode and decode memories, making them easier to recall and reflect upon.

---

## **2. How EMO-7 Works**

EMO-7 breaks down an event into seven key elements, each represented by a digit (0-9). These elements include your emotional response and the event's context and details. By assigning a number to each aspect, you create a unique code that encapsulates the essence of the memory.

---

## **3. Understanding the Categories**

Each digit in the EMO-7 code corresponds to a specific category. Below is an overview of what each digit represents and the possible options you can choose from.

## **4. Using EMO-7**

### **Encoding Your Experience**

1. **Reflect on the Event:**
   - Think about the situation you want to encode.

2. **Identify Each Component:**
   - **Triggering Emotion:** How do you feel when you recall this event?
   - **Primary Emotion:** How did you feel during the event itself?
   - **Context:** When and where did it happen?
   - **Entities:** Who or what was involved?
   - **Actions:** What was happening?
   - **Objects:** What items or subjects were involved?
   - **Relationships/Roles:** How were entities interacting?

3. **Assign Codes:**
   - Use the categories above to assign a number (0-9) to each component.

4. **Create the EMO-7 Code:**
   - Sequence the digits as follows:
     ```
     [Triggering Emotion][Primary Emotion][Context][Entity][Action][Object][Relationship/Roles]
     ```
   - Example: `2-0-4-0-4-9-1`

### **Decoding the Code**

1. **Read Each Digit:**
   - Look at each number in the sequence.

2. **Map to Categories:**
   - Refer to the categories to understand what each digit represents.

3. **Reconstruct the Event:**
   - Combine the interpreted components to recall the full situation.
