## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the **EMO-7 Framework Reference Guide (Version 1.1)**. The EMO-7 Framework is a **seven-digit numerical encoding system** designed to help you mentally encode and decode memorable situations by capturing both the **emotional components** and **structural elements** of events. This framework emphasizes your personal emotional response upon recalling the event (**Triggering Emotion**) and places the **Context** immediately after the **Primary Emotion** to enhance recall and make reconstruction more meaningful.

Whether the situations are real or imagined, this framework allows you to systematically represent them, highlighting how they trigger emotions in you when you recall them.

---

## **2. Encoding Structure Overview**

### **Updated Encoding Structure**

The **EMO-7 Framework** transforms real-life or imagined situations into a **seven-digit numerical code**. Each digit represents a specific category, integrating both emotional and structural aspects of an event.

#### **Encoding Structure:**

```
[Triggering Emotion][Primary Emotion][Context][Entity][Action][Object][Relationship/Roles]
```

- **Digit 1:** Triggering Emotion (your emotion upon recalling the event)
- **Digit 2:** Primary Emotion (emotions of the entities involved during the event)
- **Digit 3:** Context (additional information about the event)
- **Digits 4-7:** Structural components of the event:
  - **Digit 4:** Entities
  - **Digit 5:** Actions
  - **Digit 6:** Objects
  - **Digit 7:** Relationships/Roles

This structure emphasizes your personal emotional response and provides immediate context, aiding in meaningful recall and reconstruction of events.

---

## **3. Category Definitions and Codes**

Each digit in the seven-digit code corresponds to a specific category. Below are the detailed definitions and assigned codes for each category, sorted by valence where applicable.
